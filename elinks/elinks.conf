## ELinks 0.18.GIT configuration file

## This is ELinks configuration file. You can edit it manually,
## if you wish so; this file is edited by ELinks when you save
## options through UI, however only option values will be altered
## and missing options will be added at the end of file; if option
## is not written in this file, but in some file included from it,
## it is NOT counted as missing. Note that all your formatting,
## own comments and so on will be kept as-is.
##
## Obviously, if you don't like what ELinks is going to do with
## this file, you can change it by altering the config.saving_style
## option. Come on, aren't we friendly guys after all?

    ## document.cache.cache_redirects [0|1]
    #  Cache even redirects sent by server (usually thru HTTP by a 302 HTTP code
    #  and a Location header). This was the original behaviour for quite some
    #  time, but it causes problems in a situation very common to various web
    #  login systems - frequently, when accessing a certain location, they will
    #  redirect you to a login page if they don't receive an auth cookie, the
    #  login page then gives you the cookie and redirects you back to the
    #  original page, but there you have already cached redirect back to the
    #  login page! If this option has value of 0, this malfunction is fixed, but
    #  occasionally you may get superfluous (depends on how you take it ;-)
    #  requests to the server. If this option has value of 1, experienced users
    #  can still workaround it by clever combination of usage of reload, jumping
    #  around in session history and hitting ctrl+enter.
    #  
    #  Note that this option is checked when retrieving the information from
    #  cache, not when saving it to cache - thus if you enable it, even previous
    #  redirects will be taken from cache instead of asking the server.

    #  initially loaded or most recently revalidated with the server, the server
    #  will be checked in case there is a more up-to-date version of the

    #  1 is use document colors if available, except background
    #  2 is use document colors, including background. This can
    #    mostly look very impressive, but some sites will appear
    #    really ugly. Note, that obviously if the background is
    #    not black, it will break the behaviour of transparency.
